Design Summary
--------------
Number of errors   :   1
Number of warnings :   2

Section 1 - Errors
------------------
ERROR:Pack:1107 - Pack was unable to combine the symbols listed below into a
   single IOB component because the site type selected is not compatible. The
   component type is determined by the types of logic and the properties and
   configuration of the logic it contains. In this case an IO component of type
   IOB was chosen because the IO contains symbols and/or properties consistent
   with output or bi-directional usage and contains no other symbols or
   properties that require a more specific IO component type. Please double
   check that the types of logic elements and all of their relevant properties
   and configuration options are compatible with the physical site type of the
   constraint.

   Summary:
   Symbols involved:
   	BUF symbol "CLRin_OBUF" (Output Signal = CLRin)
   	PAD symbol "CLRin" (Pad Signal = CLRin)
   Component type involved: IOB
   Site Location involved: G12
   Site Type involved: IBUF


Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:Pack:249 - The following adjacent carry multiplexers occupy different
   slice components.  The resulting carry chain will have suboptimal timing.
   	XLXI_9/XLXI_3/Mcompar_cnt1M_cmp_ge0000_cy<10>
   	XLXI_9/XLXI_3/Mcount_cnt1M_cy<0>
WARNING:Pack:249 - The following adjacent carry multiplexers occupy different
   slice components.  The resulting carry chain will have suboptimal timing.
   	XLXI_5/Mcompar_cnt1M_cmp_ge0000_cy<10>
   	XLXI_5/Mcount_cnt1M_cy<0>

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs.
